# MyMapEditor
This Application is called a MapEditor. In this a user can select any mode to draw on map. Different Modes are Points, Lines, Polygons and Multipoint. Also a user can have redo, undo and delete options as well. Also I have provided them with a feature where they can change the Basemaps and do their editing.
